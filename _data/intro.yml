text: As a solution architect for connected services on the Bosch IoT Cloud I apply my experiences in software development to make driving safer and more comfortable by leveraging the potential of connected vehicles. Working with latest technologies like Cloudfoundry, Docker, Gitlab, nodeJS allowed me to broaden my skills from ISO conform software development, prototyping and framework development to latest tech, agile development and designing microservice oriented architectures. I like to think of myself as a versatile developer that is capable of quickly understanding and adapting to new concepts and technologies.

  In my free time I take part in the Stuttgart area meetup scene and learn about new technologies like blockchain and machine learning. I have always enjoyed building small side projects but only lately started publishing them openly on GitHub. These private projects allow me to bring new ideas into my professional projects as well.
